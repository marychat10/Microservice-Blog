#### Deploy a .NET application using Elastic Beanstalk

## Step 1 Create an environment 

An AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment is a collection of AWS resources running an application version. You can deploy multiple environments when you need to run multiple versions of an application. For example, you might have development, integration, and production environments.

#### Cloud is aiding Microservices

For creating, running, and upgrading resilient and highly scalable applications, microservices are an excellent option. AWS offers a lot of controlled building blocks to handle any element of the implementation of microservices and offers all the resources required to substitute these components with open source alternatives. Due to the variety of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS solutions, and SDK packages provided by this cloud platform, Amazon Web Services is one of the best options for deploying a microservice-based application. To support software of any complexity and size, AWS offers a large array of building blocks.
