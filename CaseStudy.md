####  Amazon Lambda use in implementing a microservice

I would like to write a case study about Amazon Lambada implementation of microservices. Amazon provides various services that can be used to develop applications for 
microservices. I am currently using AWS Elastic Beanstalk for a project, but learning more about Lambda would be cool. I'd like to do research and learn more about the advantages.
In the future, I want to use Lambada, so it's important that I understand the basics now before I play with the tool.
