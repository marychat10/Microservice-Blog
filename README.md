# How _Uber_ switched from monolithic architecture to microservice architecture
***
#### Monolithic Architecture

When **Uber** was a startup they built their solution for a single offering in a single city. 
Features such as passenger management, billing, notification features, payments, trip management and driver management were composed within a single framework.
As they grew they had problems arised :

+ All the features had to be re-built, deployed and tested again and again to update a single feature.
+ Fixing bugs became extremely difficult in a single repository as developers had to change the code again and again.
+ Scaling the features simultaneously with the introduction of new features worldwide was quite tough to be handled together.
